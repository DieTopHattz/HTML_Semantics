        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p style = "line-height: 1.5;">J.R.R. Tolkien (John Ronald Reuel Tolkien) was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein, South Africa. After the death of his father, he moved with his mother and brother to England, where he spent most of his life. From a young age, Tolkien showed a great love for languages and storytelling, interests that would later influence his writing and academic career.</p>

        <p style = "line-height: 1.5;">He studied at Oxford University and later became a professor of English language and literature. During his time at Oxford, Tolkien began developing the fictional languages and myths that would form the basis of Middle-earth. His first major success came with The Hobbit in 1937, followed by The Lord of the Rings trilogy between 1954 and 1955, which established him as one of the greatest fantasy authors of all time.</p>

        <p style = "line-height: 1.5;">Beyond his novels, Tolkien also wrote The Silmarillion and many other works that expanded his mythological world. He was married to Edith Bratt, with whom he had four children. J.R.R. Tolkien passed away on September 2, 1973, in Bournemouth, England. His stories continue to captivate readers and inspire countless works in literature, film, and art.</p>
